## Adoption Website

- Created all html css js files and linked them.
- Created div elements in html file and added appropriate ids.
- Created forEach loops to cycle through pets array and print to dom
- Did some styling to make sure the boxes displayed correctly.
- Created a function to add a "typeColor" to each object in the pets array depending on what type of animal it is. Called this function in init before the petBuilder function. This is how I got each card to display the right color at the bottom.
- Did some more styling to make it look pretty.
- Added a non-functional 'delete' button.
- Added filtering functionality to the top buttons. (yay, it worked)
- Added delete functionality using event.target.outerText to select the 'Delete' button.
